Getting Started
===============

Some general instructions about how to get started with the code.

Should mention that the central driver is
:doc:`moldriver <./repos/moldriver/docs/index>`,
so anyone who just wants to run the Auto Mech without making use of its
submodules should look there to get started.

Perhaps the "About Auto Mech" page should be merged into this one as well?
